# Traffic-Light

Traffic light state machine

## Assumptions

The foundation of the traffic light state machine project is a basic four-way intersection with signals for all directions. The primary traffic flow is along the East-West direction, while the North-South direction serves as the secondary route. The signals for the secondary direction are actuated using metal-detecting loop sensors. Each signal consists of three sections: red, yellow, and green, operating in accordance with South Carolina traffic regulations.
